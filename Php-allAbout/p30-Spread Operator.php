//PHP recognizes the three dots symbol (...) as the spread operator. The spread operator is also sometimes called the splat operator.
//In the example below, the elements in $arr1 are inserted in $arr2 after a list of its own elements.

   $arr2 = [1,2,3, ...$arr1];
//use print_r to print an array.

   $arr2 = [4,5,6];
   $arr3 = [...$arr1, ...$arr2];

PHP provides several functions to work with dates and times. Here are some of the most commonly used date functions in
PHP:

**Getting the Current Date**

The `date()` function is used to get the current date and time.
```
<?php
  echo date("Y-m-d H:i:s"); // outputs the current date and time
?>
```
The `date()` function takes a format string as an argument, which specifies the format of the output date and time.

**Getting the Current Time**

The `time()` function is used to get the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT).
```
<?php
  echo time(); // outputs the current time in seconds
?>
```
**Formatting Dates**

The `date()` function can be used to format dates in a specific way. For example, to get the current date in the format
"YYYY-MM-DD", you can use the following code:
```
<?php
  echo date("Y-m-d"); // outputs the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
?>
```
**Parsing Dates**

The `strtotime()` function is used to parse a date string and convert it to a Unix timestamp.
```
<?php
  $date_string = "2022-07-25";
  $timestamp = strtotime($date_string);
  echo $timestamp; // outputs the Unix timestamp for the date "2022-07-25"
?>
```
**Working with Date Intervals**

The `DateInterval` class is used to work with date intervals, which are used to represent a period of time.
```
<?php
  $interval = new DateInterval("P1D"); // creates a date interval for 1 day
  echo $interval->format("%R%a days"); // outputs "1 day"
?>
```
**Working with DateTime Objects**

The `DateTime` class is used to work with date and time objects.
```
<?php
  $date = new DateTime("2022-07-25 14:30:00");
  echo $date->format("Y-m-d H:i:s"); // outputs "2022-07-25 14:30:00"
?>
```
These are just a few examples of the many date functions available in PHP.
